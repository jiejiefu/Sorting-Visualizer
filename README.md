## To Be Implemented
- Add a dropdown menu to all sort and submit button to sort.
- Update NUMBER_OF_ARRAY_BARS every time window size is changed
- Input slider should be integrated with array bar size
- Implement quick sort 3, shell sort
- Update with sorted array after visualization
- Stop the algorithm when reset button is pressed
- Github Actions build ERR!

## NOTES
- Huge thanks to [Clément Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu) for this project idea.

## 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
